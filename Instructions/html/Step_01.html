%% Step 1: Requirements Traceability
%
%% Introduction
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_WhatNow.png>>
%
% Building executable specifications is an effective and proven way to
% communicate design ideas and documentation of low level requirements.
% Simulink and Stateflow are ideal platforms for defining executable
% specifications in embedded software development.  In the model-based 
% development process these executable specifications are then elaborated
% to create production code ready models. 
%
% Executable specifications provide an opportunity for early validation of
% requirements. You can enhance this by providing a link between parts of
% your model and the corresponding requirements. And you can answer the 
% question:  _Are all my requirements implemented?_
%
% *Simulink Requirements* provides a requirements editor to enable you to
% author requirements without an external tool.  *Simulink Requirements*
% allows you to associate (or link) requirements to the implementation in 
% Simulink models and to verification test cases in *Simulink Test*.
%
% You can use *Simulink Requirements* to demonstrate requirements 
% traceability by:  
%
% * Authoring requirements and importing external requirements for linking
% * Creating "implementation" links to Simulink blocks, to 
% Stateflow objects and to lines within a MATLAB Function Block
% * Creating "verification" links to test cases authored in Simulink Test
% * Using the requirements editor (a requirements centric view) to navigate 
% to the implementation and test cases
% * Creating a code generation report with hyperlinks to the requirements 
% 
% In the workshop, we will use *Simulink Requirements* to create and view
% two types of requirement links:
%
% * Implementation links
% * Verification links
% 
% As we said above, we will answer the question:  _Are all my requirements 
% implemented?_  The verification links will answer the question:  _Does the 
% implementation pass all functional requirements?_  We will pull ahead the
% execution of the tests to demonstrate the implementation meets the
% functional requirements along with the requirements traceability to the test 
% cases.  In a later step we will show in detail how to create the test cases. 
%
%% Verification and Validation Tools Used
% 
% * Simulink Requirements
% * Simulink Test
%
%% What requirements are implemented in the model? 
%
% Let's first take a look at a set of requirements for our Cruise Control 
% model authored in *Simulink Requirements*. 
%
% Open the requirements in the Requirements Editor: *MW_CruiseControl.slreqx* –
% *<matlab:open_system('CruiseControl_Req.slx');uiopen('MW_CruiseControl.slreqx',1); click here>*.
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_ReqNav.png>>
%
% From the Requirements Editor you can navigate from the requirement to the
% model object using the implementation link as shown above.  To navigate 
% to the implementation, do the following:
%
% * Select the requirement"Enable/Disable Switch"
% * Click the implementation link "CruiseOnOff" inport 
% in the Cruise Control model
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_ToModel.png>>
%
% To navigate to the associated requirement,do the following:
%
% * Right-click on "CruiseOnOff" inport to show the block popup menu
% * Select *Requirements Traceability / 1.  "Enable/Disable Switch ..."* to
% navigate to the associated requirement 
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_MdlNav.png>>
%
% From the previous exercise, by right clicking on a block,
% you can tell if there is a requirement associated with that block, but
% what if you just want to get a "bird's eye view”?  For this section, we
% have a model that has multiple links to the requirement document.      
% To get a "bird's eye view” of the blocks with requirement links, 
% we will use the "Requirements Perspective" feature.  
%
% To enter the "Requirements Perspective", do the following:
%
% * In the model, click on the "perspective" badge in the lower right corner 
% of the model to popup the list of perspectives.  
% * Select  "Requirements" to enter the "Requirements Perspective". 
%
% <<Step_01_EnterReqsPerspective.png>>
%
% You can now see all the blocks that have requirement links have a 
% requirements badge.  
%
% To see the associated links, do the following:
%
% * Click on any block to see the associated requirement
% is now highlighted in the "Requirements list", or
% * Click on any requirement to see the associated block is now highlighted
%
% <<Step_01_HighlightedModel.png>>
%
% To view the links in the state chart, do the following:
%
% * Open the "Compute target speed" subsystem to see the links associated
% with states and transitions in the Stateflow chart.  
% * Click on transitions and states to see the associated requirement is 
% now highlighted
% 
% <<Step_01_HighlightedSF.png>>
% 
% *Note*:  Model objects can have one or more linked requirements and a 
% requirement may be linked to one or more model objects.
%
%% Linking Requirements to Simulink Blocks
%
% In the requirements list, we can see the implementation status for the 
% the requirements by displaying the "Implemented" column to see if there
% are requirements without implementation (model) links.
%
% To show the implementation status, do the following:
%
% * Right-click in the "Requirements list" to show the popup menu.
% * Click "Select Columns" to show the "Column Selector" popup dialog.
% * Add the "Implemented" column to display in the "Requirements list"
%
% <<Step_01_ReqPerspectivePopupMenu.png>>
%
% <<Step_01_ReqPerspectiveColumnUI.png>>
%
% <<Step_01_MissingInterfaceReqsLinks.png>>
%
% From the implementation status we can see that (2) of the "Interface"
% requirements have no implementation links: 
%
% * Vehicle Speed Input
% * Vehicle Brake Input
%
% Return to the top level of the Cruise Control model.
% From the model, we can also see that the "Speed" inport and the "Brake"
% inport are not linked as shown by the absence of the "requirements
% badge".  
%
% <<Step_01_MissingInterfaceMdlLinks.png>>
%
% This may have happened due to missing requirements that were 
% found during the implementation design. These requirements are color 
% coded "green" to show they were created after the implementation.
%
% The next task is to link these ports to the correct new requirement.
% To link the "Vehicle Speed Input" requirements to the "Speed" inport, drag
% the requirement to the block.  And do the same for linking "Vehicle Brake
% Input" to the model "Brake" inport.
%
% <<Step_01_SpeedInportLinking.png>>
%
% Verify the links are correct by clicking on the model object and
% checking the correct requirement is highlighted.  You can also select
% the requirement to see the proper model object is highlighted.
%
% This completes the exercise of linking requirements to Simulink objects.
% We will now repeat this for Stateflow in the next exercise.
%
%% Linking Requirements to Stateflow Objects
%
% Open the "Compute target speed" state chart. Looking at the requirements 
% link badges on the transitions, there were some inconsistencies with 
% regard to the transitions with links and other transitions without links. 
% One inconsistency to note is that both "hold" function transitions are 
% are not linked to requirements.  
%
% _We are pulling ahead an issue that we 
% will find in a later step to illustrate linking to Stateflow objects._
%
% <<Step_01_SF_NotLinked.png>>
%
% After reviewing the requirements, it was determined that there were not 
% any requirements for the "hold" function.  These have been added to the 
% requirements document to capture the "hold" function.  As you can see the
% (2) new "hold" requirements have no implementation links.  We will now
% link these new requirements to the "hold" transitions.
%
% The same linking mechanism for the Simulink blocks can be applied to 
% Stateflow objects.  To link the new "hold" function requirements to the 
% Stateflow "hold" transitions, do the following:
%
% * Select the requirement: "2.10 Continuous "Accelerate" input increases..."
% * Drag to the transition connected to the "Accel" state, 
% "[after(10/holdrate*incdec,tick)]".
% * Next, select the requirement: "2.11 Continuous "Decelerate" input
% decreases..."
% * Drag to the transition connected to the "Coast" state, 
% "[after(10/holdrate*incdec,tick)]".
% * Verify the links are correct by clicking on the transitions and
% requirements to check the associated links.
%
% After you've completed the Statelflow linking task, you can exit the 
% "Requirement Perspective" by doing the following: 
% 
% * Select the "perspective" badge and click "Exit Perspective".
% model.  
%
% <<Step_01_ExitReqsPerspective.png>>
%
%% What are the test cases to verify the implementation?
%
% In the previous sections we showed how to create and view the
% implementation links to the requirements.  In this section we discuss how
% to create and view verification links to the requirements.  Functional
% requirements require some form of verification to demonstrate the
% implementation behavior is meeting the requirements.  Typically this is
% acoomplished with a set of tests that check for the expected response to a
% stimulus designed to exercise the requirement function.
%
% To show the requirement links to test cases we will return to the
% "Requirements Editor" and open the associated *Simulink Test* file,
% "CruiseControl_TestCase.mldatx":
% *<matlab:uiopen('CruiseControl_TestCase.mldatx',1);uiopen('MW_CruiseControl.slreqx',1); click here>*.
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_ReqEditor.png>>
%
% In addition to the implementation link, the requirement also has a
% verification link to navigate to the test case in *Simulink Test*.
%
% To navigate to the test case, do the following:
%
% * Click on the verification link "Init Not Enable or Engaged"
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_TestMgr.png>>
%
% The test case is now displayed in *Simulink Test* along with the 
% requirement summary hyperlink to navigate back to the associated
% requirement.
%
% To navigate back to the requirement, do the following:
%
% * Expand the "Requirement"
% * Click on the requirement link "Init Not Enable or Engaged"
%
% As we did before in the "Requirements Perspective", we can get an overall
% status of the implementation and the verification.  With the verification
% status we can easily to see what requirements have linked test cases and
% the result of the test case.  
% 
% To show the implementation status and the verification status, do the 
% following:
%
% * Right-click in the "Requirements Editor" to show the popup menu.
% * Click "Select Columns" to show the "Column Selector" popup dialog.
% * Add the "Implemented" and "Verified" column 
%
% <<Step_01_ReqEditorPopupMenu.png>>
%
% <<Step_01_ReqEditorInitStatus.png>>
% 
% Now we can see all the requirements in the "Functional" section have
% implementation and verification links.  Currently the verification status
% is "unknown" so we need to execute the test cases to update the status.
%
% To update the verification status, do the following:
%
% * Navigate back to "Test Manager"
% * Select the "TestSuite"
% * Right-click on the "TestSuite" and select "Run"
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_TestMgrRun.png>>
%
% <<Step_01_CruiseControl_TestMgrResults.png>>
%
% Once the tests are completed, press "Refresh" to update the verification
% status with the test results.
%
% <<Step_01_ReqEditorFinalStatus.png>>
%
%% Demonstrating Traceability to the Code
%
% Now that we have good traceability from the requirement to the model 
% object.  Let’s work through a method that will demonstrate the complete 
% traceability from requirement to model to source code. 
%
% Save the implementation links in the model by 
% *Analysis/Requirements/Links File/Save Links* so our changes will be used
% during code generation
%
% To generate the code, do the following:
%
% # Under *Code*, select *C/C++ Code*, and *Build Model*. Note: the
% options for embedding the requirement comments in the C source code have
% already been set.
%
% <<Step_01_BuildModelMenu.png>>
%
% <<Step_01_BuildReqConfig.png>>
%
% After the code has been generated (should be 5-10 sec), the following
% code generation report should open: 
% 
% <<Step_01_CodegenRptMdlLinks.png>>
%
% Notice the links to the model blocks embedded in the code comments.
% 
% * Click on one of the *'<Root>/Brake'* links to highlight the 
% "Brake" inport block in the model.
%
% <<Step_01_CodegenRptHiliteBlock.png>>
%
% Next, we are going to use the *Navigate to Code* function to return from
% the model to the code.  
%
% * Right-click on the highlighted "Brake" inport block
% * Select *C/C++ Code* and *Navigate to C/C++ Code*.
% 
% <<Step_01_NavigateToCodeMenu.png>>
%
% This should take you back to the code generation report with the code 
% comment associated with that block highlighted.
%
% <<Step_01_CodegenRptHiliteCode.png>>
% 
% Now we will navigate to a requirement using hyperlinks in the code generation
% report: 
%
% * Click on *"1.  Vehicle Brake Input"* to navigate to the associated 
% requirement. 
%
% <<Step_01_CodegenRptReqLinks.png>>
%
% The "Requirements Editor" is displayed with the associated requirement
% highlighted.
%
% <<Step_01_LinkedReqFromCode.png>>
% 
% With these functions shown above, you can go from Requirement to Model to
% Source Code, or directly from Source Code to Requirement to demonstrate
% requirements traceability.
%
%% Generating a Requirements Web View
%
% With any type of structured verification and validation activity, it is
% important to track what has been done.  This is especially true when it
% comes to requirements traceability.  With *Simulink Requirements*,
% you can generate a web view report that contains a snapshot of the model 
% that is highlighted to show the links and provides a means to navigate to
% the requirement.
% 
% To show the reporting feature:
%
% * Select *Analysis/Requirements Traceability/Generate Web View* option. 
% 
% <<Step_01_GenReqWebView.png>>
%
% An html report similar to the following screenshot should appear that 
% provides the ability to navigate the model and the associated requirement
% links.
%
% <<Step_01_ReqWebView.png>>
%
% Please note:  The generated web view requires Simulink Report Generator.   
%
%% Summary
%
% We have shown the following *Simulink Requirements* features:
%
% * A requirements centric view with the Requirements Editor and the
% Requirements Perspective
% * Implementation links:  linking requirements to the model
% * Verification links: linking requirements to the test cases
% * A view of the requirements implementation and verification status
% * Generated code traceability from the code to the model and requirements
% * Creating a report to demonstrate traceability
%
% With the implementation and verification status views, we were able to 
% see that all requirements were associated with at least one
% model object and many were associated with test cases.  So going forward 
% we have confidence that our model has implemented all of the 
% requirements.  We will continue to answer more of the questions in the 
% next steps with our structured and formal testing framework for securing
% the quality, robustness and safety of our cruise controller.
